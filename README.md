# Automatic Close - Chrome Extension

## 🛠 How It Works

### 1. **Popup**

- Opens when you click the extension icon.  
- Allows you to:
  - Add a domain to the selected folder.
  - Select a folder to add new domains to.
  - Delete individual domains.
  - Delete folders (except Default) using the 🗑️ button next to folders.
  - Toggle Enable/Disable for automatic closing.
  - Toggle dark mode.
  - Open the dashboard for a full-page view.
- Live search filters domains instantly in the popup.
- Pressing Enter in the input field will add the domain to the selected folder.

### 2. **Dashboard**

- Opens in a full browser tab for easier management.
- Uses the same layout as popup, but wider (max-width 1200px).
- Smooth scrolling and larger inputs for comfortable use.
- Allows:
  - Selecting folders.
  - Adding domains to the selected folder.
  - Deleting individual domains.
  - Adding new folders.
  - Deleting folders with all contained domains (Default folder cannot be deleted).
  - Live search across all domains.
  - Enable/Disable toggle.
  - Dark mode toggle.

### 3. **Background Script (`background.js`)**

- Monitors all tabs using `chrome.tabs.onCreated` and `chrome.tabs.onUpdated`.
- When enabled, closes any tab that matches a blocked domain.
- Never closes the dashboard tab.
- Works independently of the popup; tabs are closed automatically even if the popup is not open.

### 4. **Folder Management**

- Click on any folder to select it; new domains are added to that folder.
- Delete a folder using the 🗑️ button; all domains in that folder are also deleted.
- Default folder is permanent and cannot be deleted.

### 5. **Domain Management**

- Add domains via input + Enter or the `+` button.
- Delete domains individually using ❌ button.
- Domains are automatically grouped by folder.

### 6. **Enable / Disable**

- Enable or disable the extension to control automatic tab closure.
- Works in both popup and dashboard.

### 7. **Dark Mode**

- Toggle dark mode for easier nighttime use.
- Applies to both popup and dashboard.

- Popup is optimized for quick access and adding domains.
